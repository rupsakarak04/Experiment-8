#**Experiment 8: Study of Loops in Python**

##*AIM*: ** To study and implement the use of for loops in Python for performing repetitive tasks, mathematical operations, matrix operations, and pattern generation** 

*THEORY*:

A for loop in Python is a control flow statement used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times. It is mainly used to iterate over sequences such as numbers, lists, strings, and matrices.

The range() function is commonly used with for loops. It generates a sequence of numbers in the following forms:

a. range(stop)

b. range(start, stop)

c. range(start, stop, step)

For loops help in:

a. Printing sequences of numbers

b. Performing repetitive mathematical calculations (like sum of N numbers)

c. Checking conditions (like prime numbers)

d. Working with nested loops for matrix operations

e. Generating patterns using strings

Nested for loops are used when working with two-dimensional data structures like matrices. In matrix multiplication, three nested loops are required to perform row-by-column multiplication.

Pattern printing programs demonstrate how loops can control repetition and formatting using string multiplication and spacing.

Thus, the for loop is an important programming construct that improves efficiency and reduces code repetition.
